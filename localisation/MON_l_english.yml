This will also imply a higher presence of [SOV.GetAdjective] agents and intelligence specialists, which was acceptable to Demid, yet caused an anger of Genden, at which he stated that "[MON.GetAdjective] politics is considered [MON.GetAdjective] and not [SOV.GetAdjective] for a reason." \n\n The fierce debate ended with Dengen openly opposing and critizing Stalin for his interference of the inner affairs of the sovereign nation. According to rumors, he also broke the Stalin's pipe! \n\nConfronting Stalin is a dangerous adventure and Genden, understanding this, is not sure, whether this should be included in the official report to the Committee in Ulaanbaatar. "

Even Genden voted in favor of the resolution, after which he was highly criticised by Dorjjavyn Lucsansharav and Khas-Ochiryn Luvsan-Dorj of his actions in Moscow. \n\nSuch behaviour of the prominent politician cannot be tolerated under any circunstances! Stating that "Sabotaging [SOV.GetAdjective]-[MON.GetAdjective] cooperation is a treason against our country" he shall be punished for his actions. \n\nThe Committe announced that Genden...  "
mongol.11.a:0 "...will remain in office. Everyone makes mistakes."
mongol.11.b:0 "...will be removed from his office and set under house arrest."

In addition Mongolia shall enjoy the benefits of [SOV.GetAdjective] socialism in terms of scientists, engineers and military specialists. \n\nThe agreement is valid for 10 years, yet we well know that we are the major force in this alliance.

mongol.15.t:0 "The Issue of Intelligentsia"
mongol.15.d:0 "The education of our population is progressing better then ever before, yet new books and learning materials have potentially planted capitalistic or nationalistic ideas into heads of our citizens. \nMany young specialists who came back from student exchange programs with [SOV.GetNameDef] have enriched our schools, institutes and research centres.

mongol.15.a:0 "Conduct massive troikas inspections."
mongol.15.b:0 "We have other issues to worry about."

mongol.16.t:0 "Party Reshuffle"
mongol.16.d:0 "Our party is divided between leftists like Choibalsan, rightists such as Amandyn Amar and hudonets, such as former prime minister Peljidiin Genden. Extreme division of a party has lead to rightists capitalistic reforms of 1926-1928 and to devastation caused by the far-leftist approach to collectivization of 1928-1932. \n\nDrastic government changes are having a negative impact on lifes of our people. Constant shift of political compass might be explained by many factors, yet the main reason is clear: our party is infiltrated by the foreign agents and collaborators of [JAP.GetNameDef] or [CHI.GetNameDef]. This can't be tolerated and few suspicius members might need to removed from the government in one way or another."
mongol.16.a:0 "Set everyone in scope and check loyality carefully."

mongol.17.t:0 "Problem with Llama"
mongol.17.d:0 "Buddhism is deeply entrenched in minds and hearts of our citizens with 10% of our countries population being llamas and monks. Such massive power block cannot be neglected: rebellions of 1932 and Lhumbe plot of 1933 clearly indicate the need of intervention before the situation becomes too tense. Luckily, we already have an experience with limiting llama's power since Choibalsan rise to power. \n\nStaying loyal to the [SOV.GetAdjective]s, their leader [SOV.GetLeader] and principles of communism implies that we shall conduct this operation as soon as possible."
mongol.17.a:0 "We have no other choice."

"
mongol.40.a:0 "We have other issues at our hands now. This can wait."
mongol.40.b:0 "Remove those who openly opposed Genden."

mongol.101.d:0 "[SOV.GetLeader] has agreed to our plea for assistance. [MON.GetLeader] is currently in Moscow, and the signing of the treaty is well underway. For the greater good an further cooperation of the  [SOV.GetAdjective] and  [MON.GetAdjective] people!"
